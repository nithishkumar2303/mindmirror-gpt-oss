## 🌟 Overview  

MindMirror is a local-first conversational tool that helps you explore your thoughts and emotions by **talking to fictional characters, archetypes, or versions of yourself**.  

Instead of giving advice directly, MindMirror guides you through **reflective storytelling and dialogue**, helping you uncover your own answers.  

Example:  
- Talk to **Sherlock Holmes** about a career decision.  
- Debate between **Past You** and **Future You** about relationships.  
- Consult **Marie Curie** about a new idea you’re scared to pursue.
